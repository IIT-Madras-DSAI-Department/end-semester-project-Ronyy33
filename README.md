# IIT-Madras-DA2401-Machine-Learning-Lab-End-Semester-Project

## 📌 Purpose of this Template

This repository is the **starter** for your End Semester Project submission in GitHub Classroom. You can implement your solution and push your work in this repository. Please free to edit this README.md file as per your requirements.

> **Scope (as per assignment brief):**
> Give an introduction to your repository here: Eg. This repository contains a complete implementation for ...

**Important Note:** 
1. TAs will evaluate using the `.py` file only.
2. All your reports, plots, visualizations, etc pertaining to your solution should be uploaded to this GitHub repository

## 📁 Repository Structure

* Describe your repository structure here. Explain about overall code organization.
* My repo has  mainly 3 files:
* 1. algorithms.py has all the algorithms I used in my models , other algorthims which I tried are mentioned in my report
  2. main.py has datased loader , code execution block
  3. LAB_ENDSEM_REPORT.pdf is my overall project report
* There is one more file named PCA_train.py which outputs the PCA variance captured vs number of components.This is optional as I have already attached the output png in my report.

## 📦 Installation & Dependencies

1. numpy
2. pandas
3. time
4. matplotlib

## ▶️ Running the Code

All experiments should be runnable from the command line **and** reproducible in the notebook.

### A. Command-line (recommended for grading)

firstly I would request to run all files in same folder , because that is what I did , and my CSV loader works that way. So after taking all files in one folder , firstly run main.py , there is a funtion called main , which has the csv import info , you can change the test data from validation.csv to the test csv you have. 
All the results are there , including accuracy , confusion matrix , F1_score , etc needed for evaluation.
Then go through my report for understanding my approach.
You can optionally run pca_train.py to verify the plot I showed in my report.

## Best Practices:
* Keep commits with meaningful messages.
* Please do not write all code on your local machine and push everything to GitHub on the last day. The commits in GitHub should reflect how the code has evolved during the course of the assignment.
* Collaborations and discussions with other students is strictly prohibited.
* Code should be modularized and well-commented.
